Welcome everyone. Before we get started on this project, here's a few requirements I'd like to specify.

## 1. ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU COMMIT ANY CHANGES
GET THE NEWEST VERSION!!! It's very important to make an `git pull` and then commit your own changes. Otherwise it would likely to cause conflicts and take extra time to merge.

## 2. TRY TO WRITE ENGLISH IN COMMENTS AND COMMITS
Though this project is designed to help Chinese users, it is still very important to use English comments and commits messages.

## 3. USE TAB(INDENT SIZE 4)
Yes, please use TAB with indent size of 4 in all `py` and `sh` files. By the way, shell scripts should be ended with LF.

## 4. TEST YOUR LOCAL COMMITS BEFORE PUSHING
Test your own local commits, make sure it's working, and then make push to remote repository.

## 5. DO NOT ABUSE SEMANTIC VERSIONING
Careful when you bump version number, also try to read [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

## 6. VOICE RECOGNITION
Currently this version uses a free demo API.
